# ⚡ CodeCompiler

A lightweight and efficient code compiler designed to help competitive programmers speed up the testing process during contests on platforms like Codeforces, LeetCode, AtCoder, etc.

## 🎯 Purpose

During competitive programming, testing multiple test cases manually can be time-consuming and error-prone. **CodeCompiler** is built to:
- Take **multiple inputs** at once
- Automatically compare the **user output** with **expected output**
- Instantly show whether each test case **Passed** or **Failed**
- Save precious time in fast-paced contests

## 🚀 Features

- 🧪 Run multiple test cases in one go  
- ⚖️ Compare actual vs expected output automatically  
- 🧾 Summary of passed/failed test cases  
- 🖥️ Simple and fast interface (HTML/CSS/JS + Node.js backend)  
- 💾 Optional: Save inputs/outputs for future reference  

## 📸 Demo

*Add screenshots or screen recordings here if available.*

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js (for execution and comparison)
- Optional Add-ons: File input support, result logging

## 📦 Installation

📄 Usage
Paste your code and multiple test cases in the respective input fields.

Provide expected output.

Click Run.

Instantly see which test cases passed or failed.

🧠 How It Works
Accepts multi-line input/output blocks

Splits test cases line-by-line or block-by-block

Executes code using a backend engine (Node.js)

Compares each output to the expected output with smart whitespace trimming

Displays results with detailed feedback
